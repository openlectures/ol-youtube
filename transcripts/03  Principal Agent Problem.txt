So, the question then becomes can the owners always make sure that the

managers listen to them and act in the best interest of the company? So,

this is an example of what is known in economics as the principal agent

problems. Now, one of the features of the complex modern society is that

often the principals have to employ other people or the agents to carry

out their wishes. Now, if you want to go out on a holiday, you go to a

travel agent to sort out that arrangements rather than doing it yourself

because, for example, if you are going to Italy, then you have to know

Italian. So, it’s very difficult to plan. It’s the same with going to buy

a house. It’s more convenient to go to an estate agent. The point is

that these agents have specialized knowledge and it can save you time.

It can save the principal a lot of time and effort. So, it is just one

of the examples of the benefits of specialization and division of labor.

It’s the same with firms. A great deal of time and effort can be saved

if firms employed people with specialist knowledge to carry out specific

tasks and some of them employ consultants to give them advice and they

engage services of certain special firms such as an advertising agency.

An employee is the same thing. They can be seen as agents of the employer.

So, in the case of workers, they can be seen as agents of the management.

Junior management are the agents of senior management. Senior management

are the agents of directors and those themselves the agent of the

shareholders. So, in large firms there is often a complex chain of

principal-agent relationships but this relationship has an inherent danger

for the principal because there is asymmetric information: one guy knows

more than the other, the agent knows more about a situation than the

principal. In fact, this is part of the reason why the principal employs

the agent. First thing is the guy who plans your holiday definitely knows

more about a holiday location than you or else why would you ask him to

plan your holiday but the danger is that the agent may not act in the

principal’s best interest and he would be able to get away with you

because, like I said, you don’t know Italian, you don’t know Italy at all.

The holiday agent can just scam you to accept, let’s say, a lousy venue

and the estate agent may be able to convince you that you can only sell

your house at a lower price and that you can only buy a house maybe at

a higher price. In firms too agents frequently do not act in the best

interest of the principals. For example, workers may be able to get away

with not working very hard and preferring instead of quiet life same thing

given the divorce of ownership between the managers of the firm and the

owners which are the shareholders of the firm may pursue goals quite

differently from that of the shareholders which are the principals; they

may just slack off or in economics cause inefficiency.
