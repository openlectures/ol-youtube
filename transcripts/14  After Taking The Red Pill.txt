So, in 1995 the Bank of England conducted a survey of price setting

behavior of nearly 700 UK companies. Among other things the survey

sought to establish what factors influence companies’ pricing decisions

and the results are pretty interesting. So, the most common way of

pricing was by market level. They were set at the highest level that a

market could bear. Another 25% said that they would look at something

already in the market and price it according to their competitor’s prices.

The third most common way is cost plus markup. Now, isn’t that interesting.

Where does that say that “I look at my MC, I look at my MR and the area

under where they intersect to produce profit maximizing behavior.” Now,

how is that for traditional economics?
