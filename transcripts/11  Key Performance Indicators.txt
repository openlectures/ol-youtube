So, now, one concept that you should be introduced to is KPIs, Key

Performance Indicators. Large firms are often complex institutions with

several departments. Each department is likely to have its own set of

aims and objectives and these separate aim and objectives are set by

the head of the company and they are called KPIs. Now, setting the KPIs

is a tricky task because you have to strike a balance between the person’s

personal objectives or the manager’s ability and the overall aims of

the company which is the owner’s utility. So, in many firms numbers

like production, sales, profits, stock prices and so on, these are

used as measurements and managers spend a ridiculous amount of time

trying to adjust these from years to years and sometimes their targets

conflict. Now, think if a department’s targets conflict with another

department’s, let’s say, saving electricity from the admin department

or working overtime and hence turning on the air conditioner for a longer

time in the operations department, whose target goes first? It simply

depends on the political clout of the individual managers and the

bargaining process that goes on from then on.
