So, in traditional economics we always assume that firms maximize profit.

Now, that’s not too bad an assumption at all because who doesn’t want

profits but do all people want to maximize profits? Let me tell you a

story that one of my economics teachers love to tell. When I take taxis

I love talking to the taxi drivers. They usually have interesting stories

to tell. So, same for my economics teacher; he asked the taxi drivers

if they earned more on a rainy day. Nothing. Since more people require

taxis on a rainy day, taxi drivers should be earning a lot more, right?

But actually that’s not the case because, in fact, most taxi drivers have

a mental quota of how much they earn a day. Once they fulfill that quota,

they go home. So, on a rainy day they simply go home earlier because

they fulfilled their quota earlier. So, once they fulfill their quota,

they go home. Is that irrational? Well, according to traditional economists,

yes but if so many people are irrational, then I am pretty sure you can

find other people who do not purely work to maximize profits, then there

must be something wrong with traditional economics, isn’t it? Well, there

actually is. There are two reasons why people don’t maximize profits.

Well, the first one is that it is quite difficult to maximize profits.

Most firms actually do not know their MC curves their MR curves, demand

curves and so on. They can’t find the quantity at which <inaudible> and

then use that quantity to produce. In fact, they mostly do it through

trial and error and most of the time they don’t produce at a point where

profit is maximum. And also finding a firm that uses economic costs in

accounting procedures, their Chief Financial Officer will just tell you

that you are crazy. So, their theory is again a theory in economics

which can help predict behavior but even that is limited because it

depends on whether can actually accurately chart the actions of the

opponents and weigh everything out very, very minutely. I mean, if

Microsoft could so accurately predict the actions of Apple, would it

still end up like it is today? And the second reason is that profits

are simply not maximized because some firms have alternative aims and

this is the one I am going to explore more in the next few lessons.
