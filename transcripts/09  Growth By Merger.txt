Firms can grow by simply expanding their internal operations. It can

be more factories, more shops. Those are all internal expansion but

another interesting way that firms can grow is through merger in the

case of a hostile takeover to take over another firm or they peacefully

merge or they simply buy over another firm in the stock market. So, why

do they do that? Well, they want to diversify their products. A good

example of a highly diversified company is virgin. It’s interests include

planes, trains, cars, finance, music, mobile phones, holidays, wine,

cinema, radio, cosmetics, publishing and even space travel as Richard

Branson just came down from space. If the current market is <inaudible>

in decline, diversification might be the only avenue open to businesses

if they still want to maintain a high growth performance. In other words,

it is not just the level of profits that may be limited in the current market

but also the growth of sales. Diversification also has the advantage of

spreading risks. So, as long as the business produces a single product

in a single market, it is vulnerable to changes in that particular market

and in that condition. So, for example, if a farmer produces nothing but

potatoes and the potato harvest falls because of some potato disease, the

farmer is ruined. If, however, the farmer produces a wide range of

vegetable products and even diversifies into livestock, then he or she is

much less subject to the forces of nature and unpredictability of the

market. They can also gain larger skill, have more economies of scale.

They can share factories, share shipping routes and so on. They can share

monopoly power: I have monopoly in this and monopoly in that and let’s

<inaudible>. Pretty much so and they can rip consumers off a lot. Also,

because of mismanagement a company becomes so cheap in the stock market

that other people in the stock market just decides to take over its

equipment, its patents and other assets and there are a few types of

mergers that can occur. First, it’s a horizontal merger when a firm in

the same industry and in the same state of production merges, for example,

two car manufacturers. And then there is the vertical merger where firms

in the same industry but at different stages of production merges. For

example, a car manufacturer with a car components part producer. Why

would they want to do that? So that it controls the parts as well, it

cut the middleman and it saves itself money and make more profits in the

end. And also there is a conglomerate merger where two firms in different

industries merge, for example, when Siemens acquired some companies to

go into water technology. That’s a conglomerate merger driven by diversification.
