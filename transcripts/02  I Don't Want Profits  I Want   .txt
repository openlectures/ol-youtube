In traditional economics analysis, we have always assumed that it is the

owner of a firm that decides the output and the operations of the firm.

Now, notice how I have always used the example imagine you are the

owner of Foxconn. The assumption here is that the owner of Foxconn makes

the decisions but do they get to make all the decisions? Well, many large

companies nowadays are public limited companies. The shareholders are

the owners and they want profit so as to increase their dividends and

the value of their shares. The shareholders elect Directors. Directors

in turn employ professional managers, CEOs, for example, who are given

considerable discretion in making decisions. There is therefore a

separation between the ownership and the control of a firm. Now, this

causes many interesting things to happen, some of which we will explore

in the next lesson but first let’s look through how businesses are

organized to understand how the separation between owners and managers

happen. Small firms, the small ones, they are often governed by their

owners. Think about your food stall uncle. He is the boss, he cooks, he

is the finance guy, he is the cashier; he is everything. In larger firms

however things become a bit more complicated. Medium sized firms are

often broken into separate departments. Your school probably operates

via this model. They have departments like Marketing, Finance, Production

and so on. In your school there are the teachers, there are finance guys,

there are admin people, admissions and so on. The managers of each

department are normally directly responsible to a Chief Executive or in

this case the Principal though in some schools there may not be much of

a difference there. The Chief Executive coordinates all the activities and

relaying the firm’s overall strategy and being responsible for interdepartmental

communication because it’s an unitary form. So, when the firm extends

beyond a size however, U form structures lead to become used because

it becomes too inefficient. This inefficiency occurs because there are

difficulties in communication with such large bloated department and

it’s difficult to coordinate and it is difficult to control and it becomes

difficult to manage the entire organizational structure from the center.

So, then comes the M form of organization. To overcome these organizational

problems, the firm adopts a multidivisional or M form of management.

So, these are larger firms, the firms is divided into a number of

divisions. Think of Southeast Asia Apple, North America and so on.

Now, each division is responsible for a particular product and each

division has its own divisional managers. So, the day to day running

and even certain long term decisions of each division would be the

responsibility of a divisional manager. So, now you can see that in

most firms the owner of the firm isn’t actually the guy running things

but let’s complicate things a little bit more. Now, as businesses expand

all the way out on a global scale, much more complex forms of organization

appear. There is a H form or that of a holding company. A holding

company or a parent company is one that owns the controlling interest,

more than 50% equity stake in subsidiary companies and these subsidiaries

in turn may also have controlling interest in other companies and it’s a

complex web of ownerships. So, while the parent company on top has the

ultimate control, it appoints Directors and so on over its various

subsidiaries, it is unlikely that the parent company controls the

technical and strategic decisions in the company is mostly left to the

individual companies in each of the organizations. So, many multinationals

organize along the lines of international holding companies where

overseas subsidiaries pursue their own independent strategy. So, for

example, Sinopac is the largest oil and gas producer in China, it’s an

extensive web of companies all over the world but it does have a Singapore

division and three or four companies in Singapore as well, they are

subsidiary companies of Sinopac.
