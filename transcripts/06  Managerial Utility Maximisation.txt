So, let’s say you are the manager, not a boss of Foxconn. Will you be

very concerned about where Foxconn makes money? Well, may be, may be

but you will definitely be more concerned about whether you make money,

whether you get to keep you job as a manager, whether you get your

promotion. So, unless those are in line with profit maximization, then

you are probably just maximizing your own utility and not that of the

company. So, an economist named Williamson in 1960s once said that

managers fulfill certain minimum criteria of profit demanded by the

company and then after that whether they choose to earn more profits or

just slack off depends on a lot of things and they can choose to take

profits or they can just choose to do something else. So, what are the

things that managers go for? Well, they maximize their own utility and

things like salary, job security, dominance over other people, prestige for

example, and professional excellence, these are the things Williamson

says that maximize a manager’s utility. So, Williamson then proceeded

to try and align these with the overall aim of the company. So, much of

what we do in modern companies involve that as well, giving managers

stock options, bonuses and so on. It all involves trying to set managerial

utility in line with the overall profit maximization of the firm but there

is still an inherent divorce between the two.
