In traditional economics, we don’t consider risk as well. I hear you

exclaiming “What! How can economics be a proper discipline of study if

it’s so full of loopholes, so full of things that you forget to consider?”

Well, be patient. We are talking about traditional economics here and

theories that are devised more than six decades ago. Back to risk, not

all firms make profits their top priority because they are more concerned

about their survival. They might be called risk averse. They might need

a very, very high amount of profit to justify taking a risk. For example,

there might be a project that a firm can take on and then earn 100 million

dollars or a huge amount of money but the success rate of the project is

only 10%. So, the expected pay off is 10% times 100 million dollars which

is 10 million dollars. And let’s say the cost of the project is 5 million

dollars. A rational firm should be able to do it but a firm may be risk

averse and simply not do the project because of the huge amount of risk

<inaudible> succeed 0.1. So, he will rather yield a much larger pay off

to do the project. For example, he may be only willing to do it when

it’s 20 million dollars. However, not all firms like to make survival

the top priority. Some might be more risk loving, some more adventurous

and prepared to take risk and then some firms are more likely to be

those dominated by a powerful ambitious individual, for example Jobs.

The more dispersed the decision making power is in the firm, the more

worried managers are about their own survival and the more cautious

their policies are. They will prefer to stick with products that are more

popular and use tried and tested methods to money and in the long run

the company will find that it is losing ground to more aggressive

competitors.
