Some other firms rather than aiming for profits aim for growth. They

want their firm to grow bigger. Why? Because they want their company

turnover is the simplest way of measuring the size of a business. An

alternative way of <inaudible> the capital value of a company but it

depends on the up and down of the stock market rather than <inaudible>

very unreliable method. So, if a firm wants to maximize growth, it needs

to be clear about a time period over which <inaudible> objective. For

example, maximum growth over the next 2 to 3 years may be obtained by

running the factories at absolute maximum capacity, cramming in as many

he can get his bonus. The firm may not be able to finance this kind of

things and sometimes may be the long term perspective may require the

firm to pace itself and perhaps direct resources away from current

production and sales into development of new products and potentially

has a high and growing long term demand. So, what are some ways that a

firm can grow? We explore them here.
