Some other firms rather than aiming for profits aim for growth. They

want their firm to grow bigger. Why? Because they want their company

to be dynamic and when a firm grows as well there will be more promotion

prospects. Larger firms also usually pay higher salary. So, growth is best

measure in terms of growth for the sales revenue since sales revenue on

turnover is the simplest way of measuring the size of a business. An

alternative way of <inaudible> the capital value of a company but it

depends on the up and down of the stock market rather than <inaudible>

very unreliable method. So, if a firm wants to maximize growth, it needs

to be clear about a time period over which <inaudible> objective. For

example, maximum growth over the next 2 to 3 years may be obtained by

running the factories at absolute maximum capacity, cramming in as many

machines and workers as possible, overworking them and you do massive

advertising campaigns and price cuts. Such policies however may not be

sustainable in the long run and of course the manager isn’t considering

about that; he just cares about what happens over 2 to 3 years so that

he can get his bonus. The firm may not be able to finance this kind of

things and sometimes may be the long term perspective may require the

firm to pace itself and perhaps direct resources away from current

production and sales into development of new products and potentially

has a high and growing long term demand. So, what are some ways that a

firm can grow? We explore them here.
