So, most businesses actually set their targets rather conservatively

because they need to account for changing market conditions. To avoid

the need to change targets or the time they set the targets not all the

way up but somewhere in the middle.  This leads to what we call

Organizational Slack. When the firm does better than planned, it allows

for slack to develop. For example, if your target was to earn 20 million

this year and by the third quarter of the year you have already earned

20 million dollars. You think to yourself “No, I don’t need to work that

hard anymore.” If you work too hard, the target next year might be

increased even further. You have to work your ass off and instead you

just kind of slack and just keep the targets very, very low, allow slack

to develop, allowing all targets to be met with minimum conflict. However,

additional organizational slack adds to a firms cost. If a firm was

operating in a competitive environment, they may be forced to cut slack

in order to survive. Hence, organizational slack happens very often with

monopolies. When a slack arises due to lack of competition it’s called

x-inefficiency.
